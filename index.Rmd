Hello world, this is the personal website for Michael T. Connelly, Ph.D. 

Welcome! My name is Mike Connelly, and I study coral evolution and host-microbe interactions to help support coral reef conservation and restoration efforts. I am currently a Biodiversity Genomics postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution (SI), and I work between the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) in Washington, D.C. and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panam√° to study the evolution and microbial symbiosis ecology of Pocillopora corals.
