### About me

**Hello, and welcome!** My name is Mike Connelly, and I am a marine  biologist that studies cnidarian genomics to better understand the evolutionary origins of the immune system, and also to help support coral reef conservation and restoration efforts. 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov/) of the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/). My primary focus is on the assembly and functional annotation of the *Podocoryna carnea* refence genome. This small freshwater hydrozoan has a transparent body and rapid life cycle that allows studies of fundamental processes such regeneration, cell differentiation, and organismal development.

In my personal time, I am also a Research Associate at the Smithsonian Institution  [National Museum of Natural History (NMNH)](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/) in Washington, D.C., working with collaborators at the [Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI)](https://stri.si.edu/) in Panamá to study the evolution and microbial symbiosis ecology of *Pocillopora* corals in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP).

### Research interests

I am a molecular marine biologist that is broadly interested in how microbial symbioses affect the ecology, evolution and diversification of marine invertebrates. I am especially interested in how these host-microbe interactions affect the ecology, evolution, and biodiversity of tropical coral reefs and deep-sea coral ecosystems.

In particular, I am fascinated by scleractinian corals in the genus *Pocillopora* because of their ecological importance, large geographic distribution, and complex microbial symbioses. My current research is using genomics and morphometrics to resolve the species-level systematics of this important coral genus, and then will use metagenomics to assess signatures of host-microbe coevolution among *Pocillopora* corals and their associated algal and bacterial symbiont communities.
