### NHGRI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
My current research at the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/) in the [National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)](https://www.genome.gov/) is working to assemble and annotate a reference genome for the hydrozoan [*Podocoryna carnea*](https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=151718), an emerging model for studies of striated muscle evolution and regeneration. Next, we will seek to create single-cell atlases of all cell types present in different *Podocoryna* life stages.

### Smithsonian Biodiversity Genomics Fellowship

I am especially interested in how these host-microbe interactions affect the ecology, evolution, and biodiversity of tropical coral reef and other marine ecosystems. In particular, I am fascinated by scleractinian corals in the genus *Pocillopora* because of their ecological importance, large geographic distribution, and complex microbial symbioses. Another aim of my research is to use genomics to resolve the systematics of this important coral genus, and apply metagenomics to assess signatures of host-microbe coevolution among *Pocillopora* corals and their associated symbiont communities. 

My previous postdoctoral research applied genomics to delimit *Pocillopora* coral species and re-assess the morphology-based taxonomy for this important and widespread coral genus, focusing on the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP). I am continuing to work with teams at the [National Museum of Natural History (NMNH)](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/) in the [Invertebrate Zoology (IZ)](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/invertebrate-zoology) department's [Coral Lab](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/invertebrate-zoology/research/quattrini-lab) and the [Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI)](https://stri.si.edu/).

The Smithsonian's research platform in Panamá and Washington are key for this project. The [Naos Marine & Molecular Laboratories](https://stri.si.edu/facility/naos) are an excellent launch point to several field sites in the ETP that span a gradient of seasonal wind-driven upwelling from Isla Coiba in the Gulf of Chiriquí to Isla Saboga in the Gulf of Panamá. Field-collected *Pocillopora* coral samples from these sites have been transported to the NMNH for genomic and morphometric species delimitation analyses and comparisons to historical *Pocillopora* specimens in the IZ department collections.

(**B**) Phylosymbiosis occurs when the relationships between symbiotic microbial communities recapitulate host phylogenetic relationships.

My hope is that an improved taxonomy of these critical coral species will be a valuable resource for scientists studying coral reef species distributions and interactions in marginal ecosystems and will reveal the fundamental co-evolutionary processes that help generate coral species diversity in other eco-regions.

### Ph.D. research on *Pocillopora* host-microbe interactions
I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Miami [Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science](https://www.rsmas.miami.edu/) (RSMAS), working in the [Cnidarian Immunity Laboratory](https://cnidimmunitylab.com/) with Dr. Nikki Traylor-Knowles as my Ph.D. advisor. 

During my Ph.D. I completed an NSF East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes (EAPSI) fellowship in Taiwan, where I studied *Pocillopora* coral gene expression and bacteria community shifts in response to experimental treatments with bacteria lipopolysaccharide, antibiotics, and heat stress that were intended to disrupt normal host-bacteria interactions. The publications that resulted from these experiments can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2020.103717) and [here](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.814124).

I also was involved in projects funded by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection that investigated the gene expression of diverse Caribbean coral species in response to infection with the Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD), the results of which are published [here](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.681563).
