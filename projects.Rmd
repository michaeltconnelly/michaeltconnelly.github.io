### Smithsonian Biodiversity Genomics Fellowship
My current postdoctoral research on *Pocillopora* corals is using genomics technologies to delimit Pocillopora species and re-assess the morphology-based taxonomy for this important coral genus, focusing first on the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) region.

I am working between the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History ([NMNH](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/)) Invertebrate Zoology ([IZ](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/invertebrate-zoology)) department's [Coral Lab](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/invertebrate-zoology/research/quattrini-lab) and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute ([STRI](https://stri.si.edu/)).

### Ph.D. research on *Pocillopora* host-microbe interactions
I completed my Ph.D. at the [University of Miami]() Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science ([RSMAS]()), working in the [Cnidarian Immunity Laboratory]() with Dr. Nikki Traylor-Knowles as my Ph.D. advisor.
