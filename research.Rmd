I am a molecular marine biologist that is broadly interested in how microbial symbioses affect the ecology, evolution and diversification of marine invertebrates. I am especially fascinated with reef-building corals in the genus Pocillopora because of their ecological importance, large geographic distribution, and complex microbial symbioses.

My current postdoctoral research on Pocillopora corals is using genomics technologies to delimit Pocillopora species and re-assess the morphology-based taxonomy for this important coral genus, focusing first on the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) region.
